## Goal

- TypeScript controllers and models as the single source of truth for your API
- A valid OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) spec (2.0 or 3.0 if you choose üòç) is generated from your controllers and models, including:
  - Paths (e.g. GET /users)
  - Definitions based on TypeScript interfaces (models)
  - Parameters/model properties marked as required or optional based on TypeScript (e.g. myProperty?: string is optional in the OpenAPI spec)
  - jsDoc supported for object descriptions (most other metadata can be inferred from TypeScript types)
- Routes are generated for middleware of choice
  - Express, Ultimate Express, Hapi, and Koa currently supported, other middleware can be supported using a simple handlebars template
  - Validate request payloads

## Philosophy

- Rely on TypeScript type annotations to generate API metadata if possible
- If regular type annotations aren't an appropriate way to express metadata, use decorators
- Use jsdoc for pure text metadata (e.g. endpoint descriptions)
- Minimize boilerplate
- Models are best represented by interfaces (pure data structures), but can also be represented by classes
- Runtime validation of tsoa should behave as closely as possible to the specifications that the generated OpenAPI 2/3 schema describes. Any differences in validation logic are clarified by logging warnings during the generation of the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) and/or the routes.
  - Please note that by enabling OpenAPI 3 you minimize the chances of divergent validation logic since OpenAPI 3 has a more expressive schema syntax.
